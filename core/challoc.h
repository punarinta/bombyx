/*
 * challoc - chunk allocator
 * Creates an object that allocates a large buffer for allocations
 * of many same sized objects. The buffer can be used to reuse
 * allocated objects as well as to free the memory used for them
 * all at once.
 *
 * How it works:
 * When a challoc object is created, it allocates an internal buffer
 * large enough for a given number of objects of a given size. Objects
 * can then be allocated and deallocated from this buffer, effectively
 * reducing the number of calls to malloc(). If more objects are
 * requested than the buffer can hold at the moment, another buffer is
 * allocated and linked to the first one. This list of buffers has to be
 * searched every time a new object is allocated or deallocated from that
 * buffer. 
 *
 * How to use it:
 * First create a chunk allocator by calling chcreate(). The number
 * of chunks (i.e. objects) should be a rough estimate of how many objects
 * you need -- in case of doubt, use a larger number.
 * After having created a ChunkAllocator object this way, allocate your
 * objects with challoc() and deallocate them with chfree().
 * If you want to discard all objects from a ChunkAllocator use chclear().
 * This does not return any memory to the operating systems, it simply
 * marks the buffer as "empty".
 * When you want to return the memory to the operating system, call
 * chdestroy(). Note that all objects allocated by this ChunkAllocator
 * become invalid by using that operation.
 *
 * When to use it:
 * This allocating scheme works best when you need to frequently allocate
 * a large number of objects of the same size. This is almost always the
 * case when dealing with collection objects such as hash tables or linked
 * lists.
 *
 * Why use it:
 * It can increase performance. By reusing the same memory area, heap fragment-
 * ation is slowed, locality of reference is kept and the overhead of frequent
 * calls to malloc()/free() is avoided.
